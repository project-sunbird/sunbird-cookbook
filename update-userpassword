== Steps to update user password option under keycloak ===
1. Get the access token from Keycloak , this token is required for search user and also while updating user account details in keycloak. So use keycloak admin user credentials.
2. After getting access token it will call user search api based on provider "APEKX" , with limit and offset.
3.  based on size it will try to update user details (which will basally remove  update password option from user profile)
                            
 I put limit as 10000 and offset as 0 , if value is more than that then need to change the offset value and loop run in second run , i tried to do that but facing issues.

Steps to perform this operation:
    Step 1 :       Login to keycloak and  select sunbird realm, under selcted realm  select below  options.
                   Authentication-> Required Actions -> update password (uncheck it from Default Action). 

	               * This action will disable update password required action for any new user creation flow.      

    Step 2: 
             In updateUser.Py file , provide following values.
             a. username = "keycalok admin user name"
             b. password = "admin user password"
             c. releam = "name of the releam under keycloak" // "sunbird"
             d.  apiKey = "kong gateway api key to make api call"
             e.  keycloakUrl  = "key cloak url for getting user access token" // "https://diksha.gov.in/auth/realms/"
             f. keycloakRestUrl = "BaseUrl/auth/admin/realms"  // BaseUrl value can be  ""https://diksha.gov.in"
             g. filterKey = "PROVIDER VALUE on which you want to fetch user"    // "apekx"

             After putting all above values ,  Run this command  :  python updateUser.py  // make sure about file path.

            This will update first 10000 user account , if user size is more then we need to run multiple time by changing offset  value. default value is 0.

            Elasticsearch  default max limit size is 10000.
